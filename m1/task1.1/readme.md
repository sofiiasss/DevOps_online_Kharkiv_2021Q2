Today we have worked with **Git** and **GitHub**.

While I was workind with Git, I used this command:
```
git add
git commit
git status
git branch
git checkout (name of a branch)
git merge 
git log
```
And other.

I created several folders and files, changed them, made some branches and finally merged them with each other. 
I have never worked with this service before. So it was usefull experience, of course.
