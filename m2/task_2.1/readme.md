**Part 1**
1. The most popular hypervisors are Hyper-V, VMware, Oracle VM, etc.
2. **Hyper-V**. It is already mounted to your computer and you don't need any license or activation key.
**VMware**. It is suitable for great developers; you need license.
**Oracle VM**. It is most popular within students that have no expirience; it is free.

**Part 2**
Oracle VM has friendly and intuitive interface. Creating a VM doesn't take much time; cloning it to.
Commands (in this case were buttons), that we have used to explore this tool:
''' 
button start - start a VM
button stop - stop VM and requires to choose one way in which VM will be stopped (save state, turn off or and send a signal to turn off it)
button reboot - restart a VM
button save state - saves state of VM
'''
Snapshots are used to save states and if it needs to return to any moment, it could be reestablished from snaps.
