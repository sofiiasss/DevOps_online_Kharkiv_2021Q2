We have created network with 5 pc, 2 servers, 1 router and 1 swith.

Then we gave all ip-adresses to all end devices and to two ethernet router's ports to forward our message.

In CLI we created password and saved configuration.

In window with RIP's configuration we have added networks to allow forwading packets.

Then we've twsted our network.
